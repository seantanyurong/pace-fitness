            <i>Written by ChatGPT</i> - Hey, my name is Sean, and this is my
            retirement dream. As a 23-year-old student and full stack developer
            from Singapore, I've always pondered whether there's more to life
            than the mundane 9-5 grind that often leads to a dull retirement. I
            refuse to believe that our existence should be reduced to being old
            folks sleeping on a pile of money.

            That's where Dungeon House comes in — an exploration of the
            possibilities that lie beyond conventional work and hobbies. I'm on
            a quest to discover if we can find greater meaning, purpose, and
            happiness throughout our lives by blending our passions with our
            work.{" "}
